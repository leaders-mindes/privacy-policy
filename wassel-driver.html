        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 27 May 2024</p>
        <p>Welcome to <strong id="appName"></strong>. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App") for delivery and logistics services. Please read this policy carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Personal Information</h3>
        <p>When you use the App, we may collect the following personal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Name</li>
            <li>Contact information (phone number)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Registration is not part of the App; there is no self-registration feature, so you are not permitted to use this App unless the delivery company creates an account for you using their administration portal.</p>

        <h3>1.2 Location Data</h3>
        <p>We collect your location data (with your permission) to enhance our delivery and logistics services. This data is collected even when the App is running in the background or is closed to ensure we can provide real-time tracking and efficient route management and shipment auto-assignment. The types of location data we collect include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>GPS coordinates</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can choose to allow the App to collect Precise or Approximate coordinates, but for a better experience and more accuracy, you should pick the Precise option.</p>

        <h3>1.3 Camera & Photo Library</h3>
        <p>We use pictures from your device's camera and photo library (with your permission) to scan barcodes and take photos to submit when needed (e.g., Proof of Delivery).</p>

        <h3>1.4 Device Information</h3>
        <p>We may collect information about the device you use to access the App, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device type and model</li>
            <li>Operating system and version</li>
            <li>Unique device identifiers</li>
            <li>Mobile network information</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.5 Recipient Calls</h3>
        <p>We may access your call history (with your permission) to log driver calls triggered by the App with the shipment recipient, including the duration of the calls. This information helps us verify communications and enhance our delivery service.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide and maintain the App</li>
            <li>To track and manage deliveries in real-time</li>
            <li>To improve our services and develop new features</li>
            <li>To communicate with you about your account and provide customer support</li>
            <li>To ensure compliance with legal obligations and to protect our rights and property</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
        <p>We may share your information with third parties in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With service providers who assist us in operating the App and delivering our services</li>
            <li>With customers and recipients of your deliveries for tracking purposes</li>
            <li>With authorities if required by law or to protect our legal rights</li>
            <li>In connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>

        <h2>5. Security of Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect your personal data. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can request access to the personal data we hold about you.</li>
            <li><strong>Correction:</strong> You can request that we correct any inaccuracies in your personal data.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can request that we delete your personal data.</li>
            <li><strong>Objection:</strong> You can object to the processing of your personal data under certain circumstances.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> You can request a copy of your personal data in a portable format.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. User Consent</h2>
        <p>By using the App, you consent to the collection and use of your personal data as described in this Privacy Policy. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. To withdraw consent, please contact us at the email address provided below.</p>

        <h2>8. Control Over Location Data</h2>
        <p>You can control the collection of location data through your device settings. Disabling location services will affect the functionality of the App.</p>

        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal data from a child under 13, we will delete such information from our records. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at the email address provided below.</p>

        <h2>10. Web View Functionality</h2>
        <p>The App may contain screens with web views displaying documents. These web views do not enable external links, address bar, or browser functionalities, ensuring a secure and controlled environment for viewing documents.</p>

        <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
