    <h1>Privacy Policy for Wassel Express - Shipping App</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2025-05-14</p>

    <p>Thank you for using <strong>Wassel Express - Shipping App</strong>. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your data when using our Shopify app, which connects your online store with delivery companies using the Wassel Express platform.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>To facilitate delivery operations, our app collects the following information from your store:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Order details (e.g., customer name, shipping address, contact number, item details)</li>
        <li>Store information (e.g., store name, store location)</li>
        <li>Expected Cash on Delivery (COD) value for each order</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do not collect or process any payment information such as credit card numbers or bank details.</strong></p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The collected data is used solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Share order and delivery details with the selected courier company</li>
        <li>Improve the efficiency and accuracy of order fulfillment</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do not use your data for advertising, analytics, or resell it to third parties.</strong></p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>We apply industry-standard measures to safeguard your data. Order information, including the expected COD value, is only stored temporarily as needed to complete the integration and is not retained unnecessarily.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Access</h2>
    <p>Order and delivery information is shared only with courier companies that operate through the Wassel Express platform, strictly for shipment and delivery purposes.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You may uninstall the app at any time, which halts all data collection. For data deletion requests or support, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@leadersminds.com">info@leadersminds.com</a>.</p>
